# 🌱 AI/ML Module – Smart Irrigation Prediction

## 📌 Overview

This module implements the Machine Learning component of the  
**Climate-Responsive IoT Irrigation System**.

The AI model predicts whether irrigation is required based on real-time environmental and soil conditions collected from IoT sensors.

The goal is to enable data-driven irrigation decisions to:

- Reduce water wastage  
- Improve crop yield  
- Enable automated irrigation  
- Support climate-resilient farming

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Traditional irrigation systems operate on fixed schedules, leading to:

- Over-irrigation  
- Water wastage  
- Crop stress  
- Inefficient resource usage  

This AI model predicts irrigation need based on:

- Soil moisture  
- Temperature  
- Humidity  
- Rainfall (optional)  
- Crop type (optional)

## 🎯 Model Objective

### Classification Model

The model predicts:
0 → No Irrigation Required
1 → Irrigation Required


### Future Enhancements

- Multi-class output (Low / Medium / High water requirement)  
- Regression model (Exact water quantity in liters)  
- Time-series forecasting for irrigation planning
